# Diabetic-Retinopathy Lesion Classification using Machine Learning

🩺 Diabetic Retinopathy Lesion Classification using Machine Learning

Early detection of diabetic retinopathy (DR) is vital to prevent vision loss, but manual grading of retinal fundus images is time-consuming and difficult to scale.
This project develops and evaluates a lightweight, two-stage machine learning pipeline for lesion classification and severity grading, implemented on the benchmark DIARETDB1 dataset.

📖 Abstract

Problem: Manual grading of DR images requires expert ophthalmologists and is not feasible for mass screening.

Solution: A modular pipeline with preprocessing → segmentation → lesion detection → hierarchical classification → severity grading.

Models tested: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost.

Results:

Bright lesions easier to detect than red lesions.

Logistic Regression achieved the highest lesion sensitivity (≈0.85, ROC-AUC ≈0.88).

XGBoost provided the most balanced performance for red lesions (Accuracy ≈0.71, ROC-AUC ≈0.81).

Sub-type classification:

EX vs CWS – LR best (Balanced Accuracy ≈0.83, ROC-AUC ≈0.92).

MA vs HM – hardest task, LR best balance (Balanced Accuracy ≈0.62, ROC-AUC ≈0.68).

🎯 Objectives

Enhance low-contrast retinal images through advanced preprocessing.

Segment background structures (optic disc, vessels) to reduce misclassification.

Detect and classify retinal lesions with hybrid feature extraction (appearance, structure, anatomy).

Implement hierarchical classification for DR severity grading.

Validate performance on DIARETDB1 using Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC.

📊 Dataset

Name: DIARETDB1

Size: 89 color fundus images (84 DR, 5 normal)

Annotations: Expert-validated for four lesion types:

MA (Microaneurysms)

HE (Haemorrhages)

EX (Hard Exudates)

CWS (Cotton Wool Spots)

⚙️ Methodology / Pipeline

Preprocessing: Resize → Green channel extraction → CLAHE → Median filter → Morphological opening → Normalization.

Segmentation: Vessel suppression & optic disc masking to remove normal anatomy.

Lesion Candidate Generation: Sliding windows + hybrid feature extraction (30-D vector: intensity, structural, anatomical context).

Hierarchical Classification:

Stage 1: Lesion vs Background (Bright / Red families).

Stage 2: Subtype classification → EX vs CWS, MA vs HM.

Severity Grading: Aggregate lesion counts → classify as No DR, Mild, Moderate, Severe.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Language: Python

Core Scientific: NumPy, Pandas, SciPy

Image Processing: OpenCV, scikit-image

Machine Learning: scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Utilities: tqdm (progress bars), XML parsing for annotations

📈 Results
Stage 1: Lesion vs Background

Logistic Regression	Bright vs Background	0.85	0.71	0.78	0.88
XGBoost	Bright vs Background	0.62	0.87	0.75	0.86
Random Forest	Bright vs Background	0.46	0.92	0.70	0.84
XGBoost	Red vs Background	0.67	0.75	0.71	0.81
Stage 2: Subtype Classification

EX vs CWS: Logistic Regression best – Balanced Accuracy ≈ 0.83, ROC-AUC ≈ 0.92.

MA vs HM: Most challenging – Logistic Regression best balance with Balanced Accuracy ≈ 0.62, ROC-AUC ≈ 0.68.

✅ Strengths

Leakage-safe evaluation (grouped by image).

Transparent handling of class imbalance.

Modular, interpretable pipeline.

Strong results with lightweight models (no GPU required).

⚠️ Limitations

Evaluated only on DIARETDB1 (no external validation).

Limited hyperparameter tuning.

Stage-2 performance depends on Stage-1 accuracy (error propagation).

Class imbalance remains challenging for rare lesions (MA, CWS).

🔮 Future Work

Validate on larger, multi-institution datasets.

Explore CNN/deep learning for end-to-end lesion detection.

Improve detection of rare lesions with class-weighted methods or augmentation.

Extend system to real-world clinical workflows.
